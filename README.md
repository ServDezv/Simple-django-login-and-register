PROJECT STRUCTURE:

1.config: This app will contain the main settings and configurations of the project, such as settings.py, urls.py, and wsgi.py.

2. websites: This app will handle the CRUD operations related to the websites. It will include models such as Site, WebsiteHistory, Location, etc. The views will handle the requests related to adding, updating, and deleting sites, as well as requesting and displaying scan results.

3. accounts: This app will handle user authentication and authorization. It will include models such as User, Group, and Permission. The views will handle user registration, login, and logout, as well as managing user accounts and permissions.

4. dashboard: This app will provide the dashboard views for each type of user. It will include views such as UnauthenticatedDashboard, AdministratorDashboard, and AuditorDashboard. Each dashboard will display different information based on the user type, such as the status of all sites for unauthenticated users, and the status of the administrator's own sites for administrators.
